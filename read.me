Project run as a part of Python Programming Platfrom assigment

*************************************************
Mongo DB
Follow instructions on mongo site - it's rather realy straightforwalrd. If you are using fedora, go with the instructions for Red Hat.
Don't forget to set the $releasever in repo url in repo file - I set it 7, as Red Hat 7 is based on Fedora 19 and later.

Instalation: dnf install mongodb-org
Start server: service mongod start
Server stop: service mongod stop

Mongo listnes at: localhost:27017

***********************************************
Flask - rest server
Install: pip install Flask
Set flask app: export FLASK_APP=server.py
Run app: flask run

Your webserver runs at 127.0.0.1:5000

Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
To enable request from the same origin you need to implement a decorator (here it's @crossdomain) and  add it beneath the route decorator.

***********************************************
Http Server

Install  lamp or xampp
Set document root in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Don't forget to change the access privilages!
Also, on Fedora, you have to enable accessing port 80 by external programs in SELinux

Run: service httpd start

************************************************
brython

To use brython, you need to include it in your index.html file:
<script type="text/javascript"
    src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/brython-dev/brython/3.2.2/www/src/brython_dist.js">
</script>

!!!
There is issue in Brython - struct module provided in VFS lacks struct class, so I couldn't use requests library for handling http requests. The issue was reported almost a year ago, but still unresolved
